# zx0_PCE

TODO-ish

Requirements: HuC 4.00 or newer

Assumes HuC is installed in the current path: c:\huc\bin
Change the batch file PCE_include if the path is different.

Thanks to Elmer aka "John Brandwood" for providing the PCE decompression code.
You can find an unmodified-full version of the zx0 decompressor in his HuC
repository: https://github.com/jbrandwood/huc

Thanks to DarkKobold for testing out stuff and verifying things for HuC,
and help sorting through which support functions go with which routines.
HuC has a few different ways to setup tilemaps.
